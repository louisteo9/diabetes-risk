## Introduction

The intention of this notebook is to show how we can quickly create a Machine Learning model on diabetes risk prediction, without spending large amount of time optimisting the model.

You can download the dataset used in the notebook [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.#)

This dataset contains the sign and symptom data of newly diabetic or would be diabetic patient. It was collected using direct questionnaires from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by doctor.

## File Description
**Diabetes Risk Prediction.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook to create a machine learning model.<br/>
**diabetes_data_upload.csv** - dataset in csv file.<br/>

## Installation
There should be no extra libraries required to install apart from those coming together with Anaconda distribution. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.5 and above.

## Instruction
Run the Jupyter notebook to understand how a machine learning model is created and its performance is evaluated.
